# analysis
This folder contains analyzes carried out on different economic issues.

They will be in the form of investigations, exercises or replications of existing work â€“ through codes and notebooks. The aim is to use the Python language in the context of applied economics.

If there aren't many files and analysis in the folder yet, wait a bit as they are coming.
